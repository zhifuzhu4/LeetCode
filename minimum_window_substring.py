76. Minimum Window Substring
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively,
return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates)
is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

Constraints:
m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 10**5
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Note: two pointers
1. Use two pointers: start and end to represent a window.
2. Move end to find a valid window (expand).
3. When a valid window is found, move start to find a smaller window (shrink).
