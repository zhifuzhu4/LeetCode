35. Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10**4
-10**4 <= nums[i] <= 10**4
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-10**4 <= target <= 10**4

Note:
Very classic application of binary search. We are looking for the minimal k value satisfying nums[k] >= target.
Notice that our solution is correct regardless of whether the input array nums has duplicates.
Also notice that the input target might be larger than all elements in nums
and therefore needs to placed at the end of the array.
That's why we should initialize right = len(nums) instead of right = len(nums) - 1.
