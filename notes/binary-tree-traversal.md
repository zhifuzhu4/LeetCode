## Binary tree traversals
Tree traversal: process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.

Unlike linked lists, one-dementional arrays etc., which are canonically traversed in linear order, trees may be traversed in multiple ways. They may be traversed in depth-first or breadth-first order.

There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first order: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

### Pre-order traversal
1. check if current node is empty/null
