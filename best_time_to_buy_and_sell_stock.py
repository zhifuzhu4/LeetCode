121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

Note:
We always need to know what is the max_profit we can make if we sell the stock on i-th day. So, keep track of max_profit
There might be a scenario where if stock bought on i-th day is minimum and we sell it on (i + k)th day.
So, keep track of min_price as well.

min_price is always no later than price, so it does make sure buy-first
